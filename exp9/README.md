Model Used
Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression was used as the classification model to predict whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic.

The model was implemented using a Scikit-learn pipeline with:

StandardScaler
LogisticRegression
Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:

Accuracy

Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified observations.

F1-Score

F1-Score combines Precision and Recall and provides a balanced measure of classification performance.

K-Fold Cross-Validation

In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k subsets. The model is trained on k-1 subsets and tested on the remaining subset.

This process is repeated k times, and the final performance is calculated using the average performance across all folds.

For this experiment, 5-fold cross-validation was used.

Calibration Analysis

A calibration curve compares:

Predicted Probability
Observed Frequency

A well-calibrated model produces predicted probabilities that are reasonably close to the actual observed frequency.

The experiment generated a calibration curve for the Logistic Regression model.

Brier Score

The Brier Score measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.

The formula is:

BS = (1/N) Σ(pᵢ - yᵢ)²

where:

pᵢ = predicted probability
yᵢ = actual outcome

A lower Brier Score generally indicates better probabilistic predictions.

Explainable AI

Explainable AI techniques were used to understand why the model produced particular predictions.

SHAP

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values explain the contribution of individual features to a model prediction.

SHAP helps identify:

Which features increase the predicted probability.
Which features decrease the predicted probability.
Which features have the greatest influence on the model.
LIME

LIME explains an individual prediction by creating small variations around an observation and approximating the model locally using an interpretable model.

Important Features

Based on the SHAP analysis, the important features influencing the model predictions included:

Glucose
BMI
Pregnancies
DiabetesPedigreeFunction
Age
Insulin
BloodPressure
SkinThickness

The SHAP visualizations in the experiment show the relative contribution and importance of these features.

Results

The experiment successfully:

Trained a Logistic Regression classification model.
Evaluated the model using 5-fold cross-validation.
Calculated Accuracy and F1-Score.
Calculated the Brier Score.
Generated a calibration curve.
Applied SHAP for model explainability.
Identified important features affecting predictions.
Explained an individual prediction using SHAP.
Conclusion

The classification model was evaluated using cross-validation and calibration analysis to understand its performance and reliability. Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP were applied to identify the features influencing individual predictions. The experiment demonstrated that model performance, probability reliability, and interpretability are important aspects of evaluating machine learning systems.
